		<h1>U Skill Starters</h1>
		<h2>214U starter (reaches corner)</h2>
		<code>214U > 5M > 236H~6 > 66H > 5M > 214H > 5H > 623H > 22H or 22L</code><br class="combo"/>

		<p>If you're close enough to the corner, 236H~6 will cause a wall bounce that you can pick up with 66H for a sick conversion. Getting a full combo off a hitscan fullscreen bullshit U skill also does bonus mental damage to the opponent. At certain spacings you can replace 5H > 623H with 22U for a fuzzy setup. This is also your whiff punish combo; Grimnir frequently can't connect any other specials off of a whiff punish, so if you want a conversion you have to spend the 50 to cancel into 214U.</p>
		<h2>214U starter (no corner)</h2>
		<code>214U > 5M > 236H~6 > 214U > 2H > 623H > 22H or 22L</code><br class="combo"/>

		<p>If you aren't close enough to the corner, do this to carry the opponent there and set up seals. If you reach the corner with the second 214U you can go into 22U for a fuzzy setup. Note that if you are literally cornered you get a different wallbounce out of 214U and this combo will drop. It's easier to stabilize this rare hit with raging strike instead.</p>
		<h2>236U starter</h2>
		<code>236U (at least 85% of screen away from opponent) > 214U > 22U > 5M > raging strike > raging chain > 5H > 623H</code><br class="combo"/>

		<p>Zoner's nightmare. You can combo out of 236U (ult tornado) if you're far enough away, or almost anywhere if your opponent gets hit jumping. You have a lot of options, based mostly around how much meter you're willing to spend. The combo listed here is the one you want to do if you can kill. If you can't kill, you might opt to conserve meter by doing 236U > 214U > 2H > 623H, or if you're close enough to the corner you can go into fuzzy with 236U > 214U > 22U > 5H > 9U > j.M (> j.9U6U whiff > j.H fuzzy).</p>
		<h2>214U starter (no corner, no meter)</h2>
		<code>214U > (delay)5M > 236H~4 > run forward > 5HH > 623H > 22H or 22L</code><br class="combo"/>

		<p>Alternate version of the no corner 214U combo if you don't have or don't want to spend the extra meter for the second kick. Was extremely difficult last patch, but the 2.00 changes have made it pretty consistent.</p>
		<h2>214U starter midscreen fuzzy</h2>
		<code>214U > (delay)5M > 236H~4 > run forward > 22U > 5H > 623L (> j.9U whiff > j.H fuzzy)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">

		<p>Slightly difficult midscreen fuzzy. The j.H is manually timed.</p>
