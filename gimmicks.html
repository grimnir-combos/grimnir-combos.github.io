		<h1>Other Gimmicks</h1>
		<p>This page is for setups that don't really have a place on any of the other pages.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen f.L Block Button Check</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > 22U > f.L > 623L (> 9U whiff > delay 62U)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-fl-3.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Unreactable crossup to make sure your opponent is holding the block button on wakeup.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen f.L Corner Steal (+8)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > (delay)22U > 5H > 623L > 9U > (delay)j.2U (> land > 6U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-fl-crossup.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Reactable block button check. The closer you are to the corner, the more likely it is to work. If you're close enough (like I was in the corner) you actually need to delay the 2L slightly or it goes backward and whiffs.</p>
		<p>If you screw up the timing the enemy will bounce away from you at the end instead of toward you. I recommend doing the 22U as early as possible after the 214U.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen 92U6U Drop Feint (+3)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > (delay)22U > 5H > 623L > 9U > (delay)j.2U (> land > 6U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-926-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Looks like a combo drop but actually leaves you +3 for a 2L that beats any mash except reversal.</p>
		
		<h2>22U 623H Drop Feint (+4)</h2>
		<code>autocombo > 623M > j.2U > rejump j.M > j.214H > 5H > 236H~4 > 22U (> 623H whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/22u-623h-drop-feint.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Requires an air seal already set. Really convincing drop feint. 623H and 623M have the same frame data, so you can press 623M if you'd rather keep the cooldown, but there aren't any routes that use 623M this late in the combo so I think it makes the drop look a little more obvious.</p>
		
		<h2>Standard Meterless j.L Safejump</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 623H > j.H > jump > (delay j.L, whiff and hit on the way down)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/standard-meterless-jl-safejump.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Looks like a combo mishap at the end of the standard meterless route, but it's actually a cleverly disguised j.L safejump.</p>
		
		<h2>623H Safejump</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 5LLL > 236H (> 623H whiff > j.H safejump)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/623h-safejump.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Grimnir being actionable after his DP catches a lot of people off guard. You can often get away with this in actual combo drops too, though usually you're quite minus and lose to 2H. This setup is an exception! Fully safe DP "drop." j.H whiffs if the opponent doesn't perform a ground recovery, but either way you're plus.</p>
		
		<h2>Fake Tornado</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.3U > 8U > j.M > j.1U > 2H (> 236H~4 whiff, stop as soon as possible to set up in front of opponent)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/fake-tornado.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>You cannot combo off of throw with this fake tornado setup, but unlike other tornado-in-front setups you're +7! Some players like to press on tornado-in-front setups to force you to block and make themselves throw-safe. This setup lets you beat a wakeup mash with 66L and convert with autocombo. Also, unlike regular tornado-in-front setups you can actually convert off a 66M (dash overhead) hit.</p>
		
		<h2>Corner Bounce-out 22U Crossup</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > 5M > 236H~6 > walk forward > 22U (> 2L whiff > crossup j.M)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/corner-bounceout-22u-1.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/corner-bounceout-22u-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>You're more likely to see this corner bounce-out happen accidentally after 214H wallbounce. If you realize in time, you can do this to salvage the uncommon drop and keep corner. You also don't need to walk forward for a bad 214H bounce, so it's a little easier to convert in a match. Second video is a way to double-salvage the drop if your 2L doesn't whiff: 5U > crossup j.M. Note that while the first video is a safejump, the second is not!</p>
