		<h1>Empty Lows</h1>
		<p>This page is nothing but empty low setups. There are two broad categories: "fake" empty low setups, and "real" empty low setups. Real setups beat mash. Fake setups lose to mash. There's a tradeoff here: the more fake a setup is, the trickier the low. The best setups have ambiguous frame data where the opponent isn't sure whether or not it's safe to mash.</p>
		<p>The fakeness of a setup is determined by its frame advantage on landing. I list the "best case" frame advantage next to the title of each setup. Anything +3 or more is completely real and beats every mash option. +2 or less loses to wakeup throw.</p>
		<p>Most of the corner safejumps on the other page have a corresponding empty low setup. Some of them have pretty obvious tells, but there are so many different combos that even a very aware opponent will struggle to remember which is which in the heat of a match.</p>
		<p>Note that there is no such thing as a 50/50 off an empty jump low. There is no mix. The opponent can always just block. They can help condition an opponent to press in bad places, or block in places they would normally press.</p>
		
		<h2>Metered Empty Low (+7)</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 2M > 236H > 5H > 623H > 22U (> 5U > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/metered-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>This is a pretty obvious low, but a good one to start with because the combo leading into it is pretty easy. You can delay the 5U slightly to make it less plus (and therefore less obvious). Delay the 5U enough and it loops back around to being a safejump.</p>
		
		<h2>Metered Empty Low (rejump j.22U) (+6)</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 236H~4 > 623H > land > rejump j.22U (> land > 5U > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/rejump-22u-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Same idea with the rejump j.22U ender. Same ideas apply.</p>
		
		<h2>Metered Empty Low (delay 22U) (+4)</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 623H > j.H > (delay)22U (> 2L whiff > empty jump > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/metered-delay-22u-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>+4 at best, but the more you delay the 22U the less frame advantage you'll have. Even you won't know what your frame advantage is mid-match, so it becomes very risky for the enemy to mash, letting you get away with more ambiguous setups than usual.</p>
		
		<h2>Old Meterless Empty Low (+1)</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 2M > 236H~8 > 5H > 623H > j.22H > j.6U > j.L > 2.H (> 9U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/old-route-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Pretty tricky. You can delay the 9U cancel at the end to make it a safejump instead. Since you're only +1, you'll lose to fuzzy mash, but the timing is difficult for the opponent.</p>
		
		<h2>Meterless j.214H Empty Low (+2)</h2>
		<code>autocombo > 623H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 5H > 236H~8 > 5HHH (> j.86U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/meterless-new-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Again, will lose to a perfectly timed fuzzy mash throw. Delay the 6U at the end to make it a safejump instead.</p>
		
		<h2>Metered j.214H Empty Low (+3)</h2>
		<code>autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > 5H > 236H~8 > 22U > 2H (> 8U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/metered-new-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Delay the 8U at the end to make it a safejump instead. You can be +4 if you do 9U whiff, but +4 isn't really any better than +3, it just makes the low look more obvious.</p>
		
		<h2>Meterless Skyhigh Empty Low (+4)</h2>
		<code>autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 2H > 8U (instant 8U whiff > j.H safejump)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/meterless-skyhigh-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>The more you delay the 8U, the less obvious it looks. Delay it enough and it becomes a safejump again (as noted on the other page).</p>
		
		<h2>Metered Skyhigh Empty Low (+2)</h2>
		<code>(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.38U > j.68U > j.22U (> j.68U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/metered-skyhigh-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Extremely funny convoluted empty low setup that sadly always leaves you +2 at best. You can end in j.69U whiff to be +7 at best; delay the j.69U to make the frame data more ambiguous.</p>
		
		<h2>Zipper Empty Low (+4)</h2>
		<code>autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 8U > j.H > 2H (> 8U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/zipper-3.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Delay the 8U cancel enough and it becomes a safejump again.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen Empty Low (929U) (+3)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > (delay)22U > c.H > 623L > 9U > 2U (> 9U whiff > j.H safejump)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-929-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Frame data is ambiguous based on how much you delay the 9U whiff, making this a pretty real empty jump low setup. Only really works midscreen - if your combo reaches the corner the timing on the second dash becomes very difficult.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen to Corner Empty Low (+1)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > 22U > 5H > 623L > 9U > j.M (> j.6U6U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-to-corner-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>More of a knowledge check than a real empty low because the 6U6U gives it away instantly to anyone that knows the matchup. It also only leaves you +1.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen f.L Crossup Low (+3)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > 22U > f.L > 623L (> 9U whiff > 3U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-fl-2.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Very obviously reactable, but you can use it to check if your opponent has a pulse. Difficult to make +3.</p>
		
		<h2>Midscreen j.22L Low (+4)</h2>
		<code>autocombo or 2M > 236H~8 > 214U > (delay)22U > c.H > 623L > 9U > j.M (> 22L > j.3U whiff > 2L)</code><br class="combo"/>
		<video controls preload="metadata" width="60%">
			<source src="https://github.com/grimnir-combos/grimnir-combos.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/video/midscreen-22l-3.mp4"/>
		</video>
		<p>Another obviously reactable low. Unlike the previous setup, it's trivial to consistently get +4 on this.</p>
